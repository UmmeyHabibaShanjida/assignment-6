    <!-- Discuss the scope of var, let and const -->
    <h1 class="text-6xl text-center mt-10 font-bold text-red-900">var vs let vs const In JavaScript</h1>
    <h4 class="text-3xl font font-normal mt-20 ml-8"><span class="font-semibold">I</span>n JavaScript, there are three
        ways to declare variables: var, let, and const. Each of these keywords has its own rules and uses, and it is
        important to understand the differences between them in order to write effective and maintainable code.</h4>

<main>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">var</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It was
        introduced in the early days of the language and was the only way to declare variables for a long time. However,
        the "var" keyword has some limitations and has been largely replaced by the "let" and "const" keywords in modern
        JavaScript.

        One of the main issues with "var" is that it is function-scoped, rather than block-scoped. This means that
        variables declared with "var" are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared, rather than
        just within the block of code in which they appear. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can make it
        difficult to reason about the scope of variables in your code.</p>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">let</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">The "let" keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) and
        is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later. "let" variables are block-scoped, which means that
        they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared. This makes them more predictable
        and easier to reason about than "var" variables. <br>

        For example:
        <span class="bg-gray-200">
            <br>if (x > 10) {<br>
            let y = 20;<br>
            console.log(y); // 20 <br>
            } <br>
            console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
    </p>
    </span>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">
        In this example, the "y" variable is declared with the "let" keyword and is only accessible within the block of
        the if statement. If you try to access it outside of the block, you will get a "ReferenceError" because "y" is
        not defined in that scope.</p>

    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">const</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">The "const" keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare
        variables that cannot be reassigned later. "const" variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to "let"
        variables in that respect. However, the main difference is that "const" variables must be initialized with a
        value when they are declared and cannot be reassigned later. <br>

        For example:
        <span class="bg-gray-200">
            const PI = 3.14; <br>
            PI = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">n this example, the "PI" variable is declared with the "const" keyword and
        is assigned the value of 3.14. If you try to reassign a new value to "PI," you will get a "TypeError" because
        "PI" is a constant variable and cannot be changed.</p>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-950 font-medium">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">In summary, "var" is an old way of declaring variables that is
        function-scoped and can be reassigned. "let" is a newer way of declaring variables that is block-scoped and can
        be reassigned. "const" is a newer way of declaring variables that is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned. In
        modern JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use "let" and "const" instead of "var," as they provide better
        scoping and make it easier to write maintainable code.

    <!-- Tell us the use cases of null and undefined -->

    <h1 class="text-6xl text-center mt-10 font-bold text-red-900">Difference Between Null and Undefined in JavaScript
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">Defining Null</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents the absence of an
        object. It is often used to indicate that a variable does not have a value or that an object does not exist.
        Null is not the same as an empty string or a zero value, as those values are still considered to have a value.
        Instead, null represents the absence of a value or object.

    </p>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">Defining Undefined</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">In JavaScript, undefined is a special value that is assigned to a variable
        by default when the variable is declared but no value is explicitly assigned to it. It is often used to check if
        a variable has been assigned a value or not.

    </p>
    <h5 class="text-4xl font-semibold ml-8 mt-5">The main difference between null and undefined is that undefined
        dictates that a variable has been declared, but has not yet been assigned a value. Null on the other hand is a
        value that can be assigned to a variable.</h5>

    <h6 class="text-2xl ml-8 mt-5">For example, consider the following code</h6>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5 bg-gray-200">let name; <br>
        console.log(name); // Output: undefined <br>

        name = null; <br>
        console.log(name); // Output: null</p>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5"><span class="font-semibold">I</span>n the code above, we first declare a
        variable called name without assigning it a value. Since no value is assigned to the name variable, it is
        automatically assigned the value undefined. When we try to print the value of name, it outputs undefined.</p>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">Next, we assign the value null to the name variable and try to print its
        value again. This time, it outputs null, indicating that the name variable now has a value of null.</p>

    <!-- what do you mean by Rest API -->

    <h1 class="text-6xl text-center mt-10 font-bold text-red-900">Rest API</h1>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center text-red-700 font-medium">Introduction
    </h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5"><span class="font-semibold">REST API</span> is the standard way to send
        and receive data for web services.
        <br>
        A client sends a req which first goes to the rest API and then to the database to get or put the data after
        that, it will again go to the rest API and then to the client. Using an API is just like using a website in a
        browser, but instead of clicking on buttons, we write code to req data from the server. It's incredibly
        adaptable and can handle multiple types of requests.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-6xl ml-8 mt-10 text-center font-light">REST API</h2>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">REST <span class="font-semibold">(Representational state transfer)</span>
        is a popular architecture that is used to create web services.

    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5"> API <span class="font-semibold">(Application Programming
            Interface)</span> is a code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5"> <span class="font-semibold">REST API</span> is a software that allows two
        apps to communicate with one another over the internet and through numerous devices.

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold ml-8 mt-5">API Using Express and Its Architecture:
    </h3>
    <p class="text-3xl font-normal ml-8 mt-5">A request is sent by the client in the form of a JSON file, and with the
        help of an HTTP request which gets a patch post and delete, it will go to the server first then, the server
        sends back the response to the client in the form of a message to tell what happened to your request.
